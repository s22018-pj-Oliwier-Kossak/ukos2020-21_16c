First request  UKOS
I used basic commands to solved exercises from szuflandia 
I am wrong absolute path with realative path.
I should remember that the abolute path (sciezka bezwgledna) always start with slash /
Ctrl+Alt+f4 is key combination for which I must be careful, because i can lost my progress in my virtual machine.

Second reguest UKOS
I was created directory tree to  experminet with chmod command,
after did this exercises i see progress in using linux.
In my opinon I should more pratice with chmod, beacuse somtimes I am getting lost with it.
Later I created some files with "echo" .
I was try to log in to szuflandio , but today server doesnot work
